0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
Python OOP

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
1. Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
2. Created a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
3. Created all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
4. Created the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
5. Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
